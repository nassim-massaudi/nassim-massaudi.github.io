I'm Nassim El Massaudi, a recent graduate from a Professional MSc program in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, at Université Laval. I completed a Bachelor's Degree majoring information systems security, Applied Maths and Physics at École Centrale d'Électronique de Paris with an exchange program in department of electrical and electronics engineering at Kyungpook National University, South Korea. Currently, I am aiming to start a Research MSc at Université de Montréal.

I have a background in Data Science and backend development. I've been a Data Scientist Intern at Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ), where I focused on synthetic data generation and predictive modeling to enhance drug consumption predictions. I've also contributed as a Research Assistant at Université Laval, developing technological solutions for the Abenakis indigenous community, and as a Data Scientist Consultant at AI Global Pros, where I engaged in projects ranging from forecasting solutions to the development of a WebApp.

I'm interested in solving complex problems, but most importantly, I am passionate about automating, or at least assisting in this avenue of, solving complex problems which is nowadays possible with (millions of GPUs) AI. I had the opportunity to delve into some interesting topics such as exploring non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods, assessing trade-offs between Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, and estimating inductor magnetic energy with a Deep Learning approach (I like research with a practical impact).

I'm particularly fascinated by the current research in AI and am committed to conducting meaningful research. I echo the sentiment that Reinforcement Learning needs significant advancements and am interested in exploring how meta-learning and planning could revolutionize RL by optimizing sample efficiency and safe exploration. I believe that the current models are not yet capable of generalizing to the real world, and I am interested in exploring how to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. Moreover, the current RL models tend to be very data-hungry because of a lack of understanding of their environment. A better understanding helps us humans to prune the search space and to be more efficient in the learning process; this should be the same for AI agents.
