 I'm Nassim El Massaudi, I recently graduated from a Professional MSc student in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, at Université Laval. My academic journey has been spanning from information systems security at École Centrale d'Électronique de Paris to exploring electrical and electronics engineering as an exchange student at Kyungpook National University, South Korea. Currently I am aiming to start a Research MSc at Université de Montréal.

I have a background in Data Science and backend development. I've been a Data Scientist Intern at Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ), where I focused on synthetic data generation and predictive modeling to enhance drug consumption predictions. I've also contributed as a Research Assistant at Université Laval, developing technological solutions for the Abenakis indigenous community, and as a Data Scientist Consultant at AI Global Pros, where I engaged in projects ranging from forecasting solutions to the development of a WebApp.

I'm passionate about solving complex problems but most importantly I am passionate about automating or at least assisting this avenue of solving complex problems, and this is nowadays possible with (BILLIONS of GPUs), with AI :). I had the opportunity to delve into some interesting topics such as exploring non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods, assessing trade-offs between Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, and estimating inductor magnetic energy with a Deep Learning approach ( I like research with a practical impact).

I'm particularly fascinated by the current research in AI and am committed to conducting meaningful research. I echo the sentiment that Reinforcement Learning needs significant advancements and am interested in exploring how meta-learning and planning could revolutionize RL by optimizing sample efficiency and safe exploration. I think that the current models are not yet capable of generalizing to the real world, and I am interested in exploring how to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. Moreover the current RL models tend to be very data hungry because of a lack of understanding of their environment. A better understanding, help us humans to prune the search space and to be more efficient in the learning process, this should be the same for AI agents.
