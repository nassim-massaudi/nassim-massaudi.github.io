**True autonomy cannot be built on language alone.**

Autonomous systems must learn to *simulate* the world, to model physics, anticipate consequences, and plan under uncertainty. This is the conviction behind my research at the intersection of **World Models (JEPA approach)** and **Optimal Control**.

I am an AI Engineer and Independent Researcher. My background spans an MSc in AI from **Laval University**, advanced research at **Mila – Quebec AI Institute**, and a French Engineering degree, a formation grounded in applied mathematics and deep learning.

**Research.** I am currently exploring the intersection of **World Models** and **Optimal Control** — specifically how differentiable environments can enable better planning and control in physical systems. I am particularly drawn to **orbital mechanics** and aerospace dynamics as a domain where these ideas feel both tractable and meaningful, though I am still early in building expertise here.

**Applied Work.** I also work as a consultant, designing and deploying ML systems — RAG pipelines, experiment-driven inference architectures — for organizations ready to move beyond proof-of-concept.
