I'm Nassim, an AI Engineer & Consultant based in Montreal. I hold an MSc in AI and a French Engineering degree. I am currently working on scalable decision-making systems and differentiable physics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of World Models (JEPA) and Optimal Control—specifically, building differentiable environments for orbital trajectory planning. I am convinced that achieving true autonomy requires agents to learn internal physics models, moving beyond the limitations of purely language-based reasoning.
